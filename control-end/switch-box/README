	Switch Box README
      ---------------------


1. Outline

Switch box is a small box plugged in the standard electrical socket (AC 220V)
to control the electrical switch on/off

We use a NRF24LE1 singal chip controller in the box to send/receive wireless
message, drive the electric relay


2. Compile

Please using the 'Keil C51' with following commands to compile it:

	Project --> Open project --> select the *.Uv2 project file

*.Uv2 is a text file, you can edit it using vim/notepad. By default we install
the Keil C51 at C:\Keil\, so the enviroment variable in *.Uv2 is:

	EnvBin (C:\Keil\C51\BIN\)
	EnvLib (C:\Keil\C51\LIB\)

and we put the public header file in ..\..\lib so:

	EnvInc (..\..\lib\)


You need make sure the above env is right for your environment. Then execute:

	Project --> Build Target (F7)



3. Write the HEX file into 24LE1

After you build the project correctly, Keil C51 will generate a switch-box.hex
file. You can use the following hardware tools to write the HEX file into the
internal flash of 24LE1:
